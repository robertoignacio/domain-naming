The Nextjs installation downloads and install next, plus:
react, react-dom, typescript, types for all of them, autoprefixer, postcss, tailwindcss, eslint, eslint for next.

$ pwd
./domain-naming
$ cd ..
$ npx create-next-app@latest

1. The npx installer will create a directory, with git uninitiated.

What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*

--> import alias because helps with the paths in the code.


2. Move the contents of the generated directory into the domain-naming directory.
$ mv my-app/* domain-naming


3. Go back to the directory of the project:
$ cd domain-naming


4. Add /node-modules and .next to .gitignore


5. Verify the installation:
$ npm run dev


6. Dev mode carries all extra bloat, but is faster to work with.
